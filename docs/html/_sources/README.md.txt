# sphinx-practise
This project is aiming to create a Portfolio page, to understand the basics of Sphinx Engine, focusing on standard practise and techniques used in Documentation as Code philosophy, ensuring the technical capabilities of the documentation engine are utilized. 

The project is hosted using Github Pages, with an eventual integration of Github Action CI-CD pipeline for deployments. It is a start of a learning journey, and I hope I can make it big.
