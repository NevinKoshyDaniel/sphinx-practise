# Technical Skills

Hi! I'm a person with a **variety** of technical and  technological skills. I have a bit of experience in various technical stacks, mainly in the domain of **Web Development**, **App Development**, **Cloud Technologies** and **ML Applications**. I focus on putting an emphasis on the core fundamentals and like to pick up skills in a bottoms up approach, focusing on hands-on execution and experimentations.

## Languages

### Highly Familiar
I am well versed in the syntactical nuances of the these languages, and may require a google search once in a while while working with them

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-000?&logo=Python)
 I learned the language during my college time, and have been using it for nearly 4 years, including in professional capacity.
 
![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Java-000?&logo=OpenJDK&) 
Java was my first computer languages, and understanding of the OOPs paradigm, and C-family syntax helped a lot in picking up various other languages and technologies. I learned the language during summer break of 2016 and was also taught during in my high school CS. I have been keeping up with the major version changes from version 7 to the LTS versions of 8, 11, and 17. I have used it for engineering course work in Networking, OOPS and App Development.

I picked up the Web development during the summer of  2018, and have been tinkering around with vanilla JS as well as pure HTML+CSS based component creation. I am also familiar some of the popular front end and full stack frameworks.

![C](https://img.shields.io/badge/-C-000?&logo=C)
I learned the language as part of engineering academia, and have done most of the course in C, including using it for Data Structures and Algorithms implementations.

![Dart](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Dart-000?&logo=Dart)
I picked up the languages as I was learning Flutter. As the language was had OOP concepts, and a C-family like syntax, picking it up was easier.

![SQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/-SQL-000?&logo=MySQL)
I started getting familiar with the SQL as I was picking up web development, and taking a course on Database Management during my engineering, helped me dive deeper into the same.

![YAML](https://img.shields.io/badge/-YAML-000?&logo=YAML)
I got familiar with YAML as I was picking up Flutter, and got more versed in it using Docker and Azure Templating.

### Can Hack My Way Through
I am able to easily comprehended these languages, and hack my way through them, albeit using a quick google search at most times.

![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-TypeScript-000?&logo=TypeScript)
I was making using of the JavaScript Superset for some web development scenarios.
![C Sharp](https://img.shields.io/badge/-CSharp-000?&logo=Csharp)
The similarities it shares with Java and C helped me use the language for some Augmented Reality & Mixed Reality projects as well as game dev.
![Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Rust-000?&logo=Rust)
I am picking up the language as a part time, and would love to extend more on it. It was a curiosity about the language that got me started, after I heard about it from recent Open Source project news and Github surveys.
![Go](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Go-000?&logo=Go)
I loved the simplistic syntax of Go, and the capabilities it possess. I am currently learning the language.
