# Github  Profile

I have been on Github since 2018, and have been an avid participant in most years Hacktober Fests. I have primarily used the tooling to understand codebases and examples, and use them as a guideline in my development practises, as well as collaborate on various projects and release them as openly available public projects.

I have encouraged friends and fellow students to make use of open source technologies, and have occasionally contributed to open source technologies. I always love to play a part in evangelising the benefits of open source technologies, and helping to increase their adoption rates, as well as helping out by contributions in the near future.

Here are a brief listing of my Github Projects
